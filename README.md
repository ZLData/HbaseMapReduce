# HbaseMapReduce
Hbase MapReduce with Maven build

This is scaped from Internet, not made by me. it saves here because many times spening significant amount of time to find pom.xml for hbase maven build because it compiles correct but not working on hadoop
It is using hbase-site.xml for pseudo distributed hadoop mode, it can be exchanged for the correct one if you are runing distributed mode
